# Vector2
A simple and adaptive Vector2 structure for C++

It's just a thing I use and thought about sharing with you guys. Nothing fancy, but still useful.

## How to use
Just include the `vector2.hpp` file and use it like so:

```
#include "vector2.hpp"

// Do stuff

Vector2<float> position;
Vector2<int> target;

// Do more stuff
```

No need to compile or link it anywhere.
